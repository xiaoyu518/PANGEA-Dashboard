abstract: "This report shows the drug resistance data on HIV sequences taken from different Sub-Saharan African countries on PANGEA and Los Alamos (LANL) dataset. Different levels of drug resistance has been annotated on the phylogenetic tree produced using the pol gene from the previous analysis. Details of that analysis can be accessed [here](http://pangea2-hiv.org/narratives/IntroToPANGEADashboard)"

# Executive summary

<p>&nbsp;</p>

##### Using the _PANGEA_ and Los Alamos Database (_LANL_) and the [phylogenetic tree](http://pangea2-hiv.org/pol/20210524) produced using the pol gene from the previous analysis, we annotated the drug resistance data produced using [***] () to see the spread of drug resistance within the cohorts in these two datasets.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### > Levels of drug resistance have been categorised into ***

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### > Time span of samples range from 1983 to May 2019 with _LANL_ sequences (1983 - 2016) used as mainly background sequences for the phylogenetic analysis of the _PANGEA_ (2003 - 2019) data.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### > The vast majority of PANGEA sequences are from _Botswana, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia_. Additional sequences from LANL are from _Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal and Somalia_.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

###### > 12 whole genome subtypes are found within the dataset (A, A1, A2, B, C, D, F1, F2, G, H, J, K) with low number but wide variety of recombinant subtypes.
